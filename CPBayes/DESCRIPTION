Description: CPBayes is a Bayesian meta analysis approach for studying cross-phenotype
  genetic associations. It uses summary-level data across multiple phenotypes to
  simultaneously measure the evidence of aggregate-level pleiotropic association and
  estimate an optimal subset of traits associated with the risk locus. CPByes is based
  on a spike and slab prior and is performed by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique Gibbs sampling.
